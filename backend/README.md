### Backend


### Requests
The only requests that specifically need a body, are Update and Vote requests. 
<br>These requests require information from the user, and therefore will have a body.
<br>All other requests can indicate the desired action by their path: <strong>Clear, Close, Details, Release, Results, Unrelease.
